I provide here relevant summaries from certain books and papers. 

Bialek's book: A 2011 draft is available [here](https://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/PHY562/WB_biophysics110918.pdf). He uses photon counting in vision to showcase the opportunities for quantiatvie, physics-style experiments to understand biological phenomena. He develops three general physical principles to study living systems: (1) Extraction of low level signal from noise, and consequent energy minimization; (2) Irrevelance of finely tuned parameters in understanding their extraordinary performance ; and (3) Critical role of the representation and flow of information. 

Ch. 1 Intro: In physics, we (try to) teach principles and derived the predictions for particular examples. In biology, teaching proceeds (mostly) from example to example, system to system. As physicists studying the phenomena of life, do not search for a new force of nature; rather understand how the same force that causes carbon-based materials to look like rocks or sludge cn, under some conditions, but also cause reorganize itself to be animate.  Looking back, many giants of classical physics routinely crossed borders among disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology. Some wished to test the universality of physical laws (eg., energy conservation); others tried to understand the sensory data in biology. .... Schrodinger ( in his book: "What is Life?") Outlined how nonequilibrium systems can generate structure out of disorder, continuously dissipating energy (*my comment: low amount?*). Reductionist view of molecular biology has shown that many of the basic molecules of life are universal, shared across organisms via evolutionary and adaptation influences. Classical biology emphasized the complexity and diversity of life. "Structure Determines Function" was clarified once 3-D protein and DNA structures were identified. He gives many examples (pg. 11) of how advances in physics helped explore new focused biological subdomains (eg., receptors and ion channels in neural info flow). Physics has developed experimental techniques that allow fuller exploration of biological questions. By focusing on methods, physicists and biologists tend to ask different questions faced with the same biological phenomena. *Early Intellectual leaders postulated that qualitative phenomena of life could hold clues for deep theoretical insights, that there should be an over-arching physics of life. His book emphasizes this view*. Looking forward: Biological questions are answered by experimental discovery, unlike physics where theory and experiments go hand-in-hand. In Physics, a set of general theoretical principles, all interconnected, define the possible based on many earlier quantitative experiments and predict new phenomena which may then be experimentally verified. A predictive power of similar type is hoped for in physics of biological systems.... Despite much progress in identifying microscopic mechanisms, there has not been much progress in elucidating  the "order parameters" that characterize the macroscopic state. A principle that differentiates the genuinely biological parts of parameter space from the rest can be elevated to a theory and used to predict similar phenomena in other living systems. **If biological systems occupy only a small region of the parameter space, one needs to understand the dynamics (adaptation, learning, and evolution)  by which parameters arrive at these special values.** To survive in the world, organisms solve a variety of problems: energy conversion, weak signal sensing, control of complex dynamical systems, reliable information transmission across generations and regions, rate control of thermally activated processes, and prediction of multi-dimensional trajectories, etc. .. Physics places limits on what is possible, allowing us to evaluate performance of a biological system on an absolute scale. *It makes precise our intuition that organisms are really good at solving some very difficult problems.* His approach in his Princeton graduate course: Start out with a specific well studied and quantified biological phenomena that has microscopic to macroscopic physics perspectives, and extraction of generalizable principles. He chose the visual system that encompasses quantum dynamics of single (photon) molecules to the macroscopic dynamics of human cognition.    

Ch. 2 First Look: Using the example on photon counting in vision. Three researchers in an earlier era experiment sat in a dark room and were subject to flashes of different intensities; their proabiity of observance of a flash are plotted on a log x scale (x is the light intensity at the cornea). It is known that the flash follows a Poission distribution (if λ is the average number of events per interval, then the probability density function peaks when K , the number of photons in any given interval,  equals λ; put another way, the cumulative distribution function has a value of 0.5 at this K value. K can take values of 0, 1, 2, etc.). See [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) article. Figs 1 and 2 in the book plots this data for these three 'subjects', presumably with different α values (due to differences in age related corneal diffractions and scattering); and Fig 2 shows a good fit with Poisson distribution for the same K =6 for all three. *The probabilistic nature of our perceptions is determined by the physics of photon counting*. A good fit was found for K= 5 to 7; consider that the retina has 500 receptor cells for a flash projected onto the retina (a retina has a total of 120 million rods and 6 million cones). So, sensitivity to a single photon means that each cell is capable of responding to a single molecular event. *Averaging across individuals with different αs will not match the Poission distribution - leading us to believe that the visual system does not count single photons*. **Averaging across an ensemble of individuals can be qualitatively misleading**. There is much to learn from old experiments...Why K of ~6? there must be a noise source in the visual system that is equivalent to counting ~10 photons over the time window (~0.1 s) and retinal sub-area. He calculates the noise (thermal iosmerization noise) as < 0.1 photon/receptor cell per second or less. People can adjust the threshold K in different situations. *All sensory tasks involve a discrimination between signal and noise, and hence different strategies to trade off different kinds of errors*. By experimenting with toads, it has been shown that this is an upperbound for noise which can be lowered with a **temperature drop**. 

Dynamics of biochemical networks: Currents in biological systems are carried not by electrons and holes, as in semiconductors, but **by ions (largely Sodium ions) moving through water**. the cell membrane is not very selective to one specific type if ion. In a macaque monkey, red cones have a peak sensitivity at 570 nm; at this wavelength, blue cones have sensitivities that are 10<sup>5</sup> lower. *These cells make that much less protein, since all cells have the same DNA template*. Fig 22 shows the cascade leading from photon absorption to ionic current flow in rods. Rhodospin is activated by photon, converts Transducin (a moleculree of a broad class of G-proteins that couple receptsors to enzymes) to its activated form, which converts PDE, an enzyme phosphodiesterase, which degrades cGMP to GMP, which opens the a cellular channel for ion current. GC (Gyanylate Cyclase) synthesizes cGMP from GTP (guanosine triphosphate). *Universality of these components meants that understanding this can provide a model for understanding an  enormous range of biological processes.* These channels of pores are large molecules (proteins) embedded in the cell membrane, and respond to the electric field or voltage across the membrane and also to small molecular bindings. *The coupled dynamics of channels and voltage turns each cell into a potentially complex nonlinear dynamical system*. Ions and small molecules diffuse freely through water, not a cell with a double membrane. Water is polar and screens the charge (unilke the cellular membranes). 
(In physics, screening is the damping of electric fields caused by the presence of mobile charge carriers [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric-field_screening)). An Ion channel (a large protein molecule) serves  as a hole in the membrane. ionic flux = *cv*, where c is the ionic concentration (~100 mM or 6 x 10 <sup>19</sup> ions/cm<sup>3</sup>) amd v is the velocity. *v = μF, where μ is the ion mobility and F is the electric field force = q<sub>ion</sub> E, where q is the charge and E is the electric field strength = V/l, where V is the voltage across the membrane of thickness l*. q<sub>ion</sub> = 1.6 x <sup>-19</sup> C. Assume the channel diameter = diameter of a single ion (~0.3 nm). L ~ 5 nm. This yields conductance of an open channel as ~20 pS. With V = 50 mV, the current due to opening a single channel is 1 pA. However, *this does not yield a square edge current trace*. These channels open and close rapidly, so on the slow scale of rod response, one sees a **graded current** proportional to the probability of the channel being open. The current produced by the population of channnels in the rod cell membrane depends continuously on the concentration of cGMP. The effect of this fast and flickering channel noise is much reduced at the lower time scale (of 0.1s) of the rod. **Evolution has selected for very fast channels to be present in a cell that signals very slowly!** Our genome codes for hundreds of different types of channels which may differ in kinetics, with faster channels responding to the more rapidly varying signals. Pipette experiments show that 3 molecules of cGMP need to bind to the channel to open it. **"Cooperativity and allostery are important themes in biochemical signaling**. The current can range 3-fold as cGMP is varied 2 fold. There is a feedback mechanism in the rod, where Ca enters through the open channels, binds, and inhibits the activity of GC. 

The first synapse and beyond: How does the retina add up the responses of the many rods so that the observer can reach a decision? Need to integrate over all the receptors in that area covered by the flash. This involves spatial summation of currents with a mean current of ~ 1 pA, with continuous background noise of ~0.1 pA. This S/N ratio is OK in a single cell, buut there will be a problem for our integration. With N<sub>cells</sub> = 500, we will have an effective additive noise of ~2.2 pA - that means confusing 3 to 5 photons with a blank. This problem is even more serious for larger areas. *Summing the signals from many cells buries tthe clear single photon response under the combined noise*. Could not be! Each rod's signal is passed through a **sigmoid (strong nonlinearity)** so the output is only a 1 or 0 and then pooling their outputs. Contrast this with neuronal transmission: it adds up the inputs and then passed their sume through a nonlinearity. His theoretical calculations (*yet to read through) match with experimental results*. Also, note that in addition to amplitude, signal and noise have different frequency bands. Thus the rod/bipolar synaps implements an optimal filter. There are two types of noise in a rod cell: Spontaneouls isomerizations of rodospin, which have the same frequency content as the real signal, and the continuous background noise, which extends to higher frequency. To extract the signal from isomerization signal, one needs a high pass filter. This unsmoothing is cut off by the background noise and the result is a bandpass filter. This also speeds up the rather slow response of the rod. 

Perspectives: (1) There is at least one example of a real biological system that is amenable to reproducible, quantitative experiments of physics; Experimentalists need to get right many things to achieve this. (2) Performance of these complext biological systems is determined by the physics of the problem that the system is choosen to solve. (3) We can observe measurable parameters such as ion currrents, filtering, and nonlinearities in other domains also. What are we doing when we look for an 'explanation' of the data? We could jump to the microscopic level and explain, but this may not be satisfying and may not relate to phenomenological parameters, when the goal is to abstract principles. **A second perspective**, developed here (with the example of photon counting) is that the system has evolved as the best solution to a problem that is essential in the life of the organism. This does not tell how the optimum is reached, but can predict the observable behavior of the system. We should discipline ourselves and insist on **criteria for such optimization**, not philosophical discussions, that allow such claims to be meaningful and predictive. We need to have a theory which defines the physical limits to performance. We should be able to meaasure this performance metric and compare its value with the theoretical maximum. also, maximizing this metric should generate some definite predictions about the structure and dynamics of the system, predictions that can be tested in independent, quantiative experiments. In the following three chapters, he discussed three broad ideas about what these generalizable metrics might be.
