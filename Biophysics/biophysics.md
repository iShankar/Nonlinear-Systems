I provide here relevant summaries from certain books and papers. 

Bialek's book: He uses photon counting in vision to showcase the opportunities for quantiatvie, physics-style experiments to understand biological phenomena. He develops three general physical principles to study living systems: (1) Extraction of low level signal from noise, and consequent energy minimization; (2) Irrevelance of finely tuned parameters in understanding their extraordinary performance ; and (3) Critical role of the representation and flow of information. 

Ch. 1 Intro: In physics, we (try to) teach principles and derived the predictions for particular examples. In biology, teaching proceeds (mostly) from example to example, system to system. As physicists studying the phenomena of life, do not search for a new force of nature; rather understand how the same force that causes carbon-based materials to look like rocks or sludge cn, under some conditions, but also cause reorganize itself to be animate.  Looking back, many giants of classical physics routinely crossed borders among disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology. Some wished to test the universality of physical laws (eg., energy conservation); others tried to understand the sensory data in biology. .... Schrodinger ( in his book: "What is Life?") Outlined how nonequilibrium systems can generate structure out of disorder, continuously dissipating energy (*my comment: low amount?*). Reductionist view of molecular biology has shown that many of the basic molecules of life are universal, shared across organisms via evolutionary and adaptation influences. Classical biology emphasized the complexity and diversity of life. "Structure Determines Function" was clarified once 3-D protein and DNA structures were identified. He gives many examples (pg. 11) of how advances in physics helped explore new focused biological subdomains (eg., receptors and ion channels in neural info flow). Physics has developed experimental techniques that allow fuller exploration of biological questions. By focusing on methods, physicists and biologists tend to ask different questions faced with the same biological phenomena. *Early Intellectual leaders postulated that qualitative phenomena of life could hold clues for deep theoretical insights, that there should be an over-arching physics of life. His book emphasizes this view*. Looking forward: Biological questions are answered by experimental discovery, unlike physics where theory and experiments go hand-in-hand. In Physics, a set of general theoretical principles, all interconnected, define the possible based on many earlier quantitative experiments and predict new phenomena which may then be experimentally verified. A predictive power of similar type is hoped for in physics of biological systems.... Despite much progress in identifying microscopic mechanisms, there has not been much progress in elucidating  the "order parameters" that characterize the macroscopic state. A principle that differentiates the genuinely biological parts of parameter space from the rest can be elevated to a theory and used to predict similar phenomena in other living systems. **If biological systems occupy only a small region of the parameter space, one needs to understand the dynamics (adaptation, learning, and evolution)  by which parameters arrive at these special values.** To survive in the world, organisms solve a variety of problems: energy conversion, weak signal sensing, control of complex dynamical systems, reliable information transmission across generations and regions, rate control of thermally activated processes, and prediction of multi-dimensional trajectories, etc. .. Physics places limits on what is possible, allowing us to evaluate performance of a biological system on an absolute scale. *It makes precise our intuition that organisms are really good at solving some very difficult problems.* His approach in his Princeton graduate course: Start out with a specific well studied and quantified biological phenomena that has microscopic to macroscopic physics perspectives, and extraction of generalizable principles. He chose the visual system that encompasses quantum dynamics of single (photon) molecules to the macroscopic dynamics of human cognition.    

Ch. 2 First Look: Using the example on photon counting in vision. Three researchers in an earlier era experiment sat in a dark room and were subject to flashes of different intensities; their proabiity of observance of a flash are plotted on a log x scale (x is the light intensity at the cornea). It is known that the flash follows a poission distribution (if Î» is the average number of events per interval, then the probability density function peaks when K, the number of photons in any given interval equals this value). See [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) article.
